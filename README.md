# Project-Mayhem

<bold> Description. “Our application helps people target what news they are interested in while being able to avoid undesirable content.”

Motivation. “Our initial motivation was to avoid spoilers to sports events and popular tv shows while still being able to use the internet to get news.”

Result. “Using Google News API and Google NLP Cloud we were able to build an API that allows the user to search the News API and filter out undesired topics. We then used the Google NLP Cloud API to analyze the text of the article to classify it as positve, neutral, or negative."

Team Efforts. “Jeff singlehandedly created the UI and helped figure out how to use a callback to. Chelsey worked on the Google News API call and getting the front end and back end working together. Nate worked on the Google NLP API call and the read time feature.”

Challenges. “Eventually, we realized that the fact that JavaScript is asynchronous meant our UI wouldn’t work with the code we’d written to call the external APIs. So we used promises to wrap our API calls and refactor the front-end."

Improvements. “In the future, we’d like to add a way to favorite exclusion selections as well as make a popular exclusions section."
